// Exercise 6 
// Instructions
// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):
// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
let bankAmount = 300;
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
const vat = 1.17;
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
const details = ["+500", "-128", "-70", "-128", "+500"];
// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
details.forEach((element, i, arr) => {
    let result = arr[i] *= vat;
    bankAmount += result;
});
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.
console.log(bankAmount);
